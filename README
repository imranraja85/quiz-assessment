A language-based quiz application that presents multiple choice and fillin questions and grades a user based on the answers they enter. Each question is unique and specific to the lesson, chapter or course it belongs to. Here is how questions should be structured:

A) Course (this assessment would have 50 questions per the requirement that 'a given course must contain 50 questions')

B) Chapter (this assessment would have 100 questions)

C) Lesson (this assessment would have 10 questions)

Use rake db:seed to populate with seed data and give it a run.
